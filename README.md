RUNNING THE PROJECT LOCALLY:

This project must be run locally. After the repo has been cloned, using your package manager of choice, please install the required libraries listed in environment.yml. Below is some sample code that I would use:

    python -m venv hackathonENV
    source hackathonENV/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

To test it, just run
    python3 main.py
